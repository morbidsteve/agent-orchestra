# Project Context — CLAUDE.md Template
#
# Copy this file to the root of your repository as CLAUDE.md.
# All agents will read this file to understand your project's conventions.
# Customize each section for your specific project.

## Project Overview
<!-- Brief description of what this project does -->
[Your project name] is a [type of software] that [what it does].

## Tech Stack
<!-- List your technologies so agents know what they're working with -->
- **Backend**: [e.g., Python 3.11 / FastAPI / SQLAlchemy]
- **Frontend**: [e.g., React 18 / TypeScript / Tailwind CSS]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL 15 / Redis for caching]
- **Infrastructure**: [e.g., Docker / Kubernetes / AWS]
- **CI/CD**: [e.g., GitHub Actions]

## Project Structure
<!-- Help agents navigate the codebase -->
```

├── api/          # REST API endpoints
├── core/         # Business logic
├── models/       # Data models / ORM
├── services/     # External service integrations
└── utils/        # Shared utilities
tests/
├── unit/         # Unit tests
├── integration/  # Integration tests
└── fixtures/     # Test data
```

## Code Standards
<!-- What conventions do you follow? -->
- **Style**: [e.g., Black for Python, Prettier for TS/JS]
- **Linting**: [e.g., ruff, eslint]
- **Type checking**: [e.g., mypy strict mode, TypeScript strict]
- **Naming**: [e.g., snake_case for Python, camelCase for TS]
- **Imports**: [e.g., isort with project grouping]

## Testing Requirements
<!-- What's expected for test coverage? -->
- Minimum coverage: [e.g., 80%]
- Framework: [e.g., pytest / jest]
- Run tests: `[e.g., pytest -v --cov]`
- All PRs must pass CI before merge

## Security Requirements
<!-- What security standards apply? -->
- No hardcoded secrets — use environment variables
- All API endpoints require authentication unless explicitly public
- PII must be encrypted at rest
- Dependencies scanned weekly for CVEs
- [Add any compliance requirements: SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.]

## Development Workflow
<!-- How does code go from idea to production? -->
1. Branch from `main` with pattern: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`
2. Write code + tests
3. Open PR — agent review runs automatically
4. Address review feedback
5. Merge when approved + CI green

## Common Commands
```bash
# Development
[e.g., make dev        # Start dev server]
[e.g., make test       # Run test suite]
[e.g., make lint       # Run linters]
[e.g., make build      # Build for production]

# Database
[e.g., make migrate    # Run migrations]
[e.g., make seed       # Seed dev data]
```

## Known Limitations / Tech Debt
<!-- What should agents be aware of? -->
- [e.g., Auth module is legacy — don't refactor without discussion]
- [e.g., Search is basic string matching, planned Elasticsearch migration]

## Agent-Specific Notes
<!-- Special instructions for the agent team -->
- **Developers**: Follow existing patterns. Don't introduce new dependencies without justification.
- **Tester**: Focus on edge cases around [specific module]. It has historically been buggy.
- **DevSecOps**: We're targeting [SOC2/HIPAA/etc.]. Pay special attention to [data handling/auth/etc.].
- **Business Dev**: Our target market is [market]. Key competitors are [competitors].
